## Rock, Paper, Scissors
This is a recreation of the game Rock, Paper, Scissors in a website. This can be a two player game, so there would be two 'plays' in each round.

A method was written to handle the different combinations of plays.

Specs for all possible combination of plays were written. After all specs are passing, the website was built where someone can go to play.

## Bonus points: Found a way to get the computer to randomly select a 'play' and so the website can entertain a one player game.

## Note:
